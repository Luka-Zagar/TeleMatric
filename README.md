This innovative project involves deploying specialized measuring stations equipped with wireless connectivity via WiFi and LoRa technology. These stations gather crucial data from various Internet of Things (IoT) sources, transmitting it to a dedicated server. Once received, the data is stored in a meticulously designed database, where it undergoes comprehensive analysis. The real magic happens when this data is visualized online, providing open access to anyone interested. This initiative aims to create a comprehensive global perspective by amalgamating IoT measurements, shedding light on critical global issues such as climate change and natural disasters.
